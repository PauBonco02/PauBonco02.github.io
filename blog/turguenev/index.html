    <p>The year 2020 I decided to read Ivan Turguenev's 1862 novel, <em>Fathers and Sons</em>. I was told it was considered to be one of the first Russian modern novels, as it consolidated the "superflous man" archetype and reflected the radical social, political and technological changes in the Russia of the Tsar in the form of a generational clash of values and ideals between the novel's characters, foreshadowing the even bigger societal shifts that would eventually culminate in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. At that time, I was full of uncertainties as for my future and what ideals to stand for, so I don't blame my past self for being attracted to the charismatic form of nihilism embodied in the character of Yevgueni Bazarov, a medicine student that proudly states he does not believe in anything. I did not know if it was because of this character, the witty arguments between him and his friend's traditionalist, principled and romantic uncle Pavel Petrovich, or the fact that this story of generational clash from the 1800s has a frightening number of parallelisms with the present, but <em>Fathers and Sons</em> fascinated me.</p>
<p>I immediately started reading other works from Turguenev, such as <em>First Love</em>, <em>The Diary of a Superflous Man</em> and <em>The Torrents of Spring</em>, to find more of whatever made me enjoy the first novel. The more novels I read, the more I realized my initial thoughts on what captivated me from <em>Fathers and Sons</em> had nothing to do with my initial thoughts. Turguenev was not a moralist, he did not visibly advocate for a specific stance in his novels, he just tried to expose them and leave the rest to the reader (unlike Dostoevski, a recognized slavophile tradionalist, who believed Turguenev was out of touch with the Russian people). Considering that, one can realize that although Turguenev sympathizes with some motivations of nihilists (critique of traditional values, desire for equality and reform), he acknowledges and critiques the inconsistency and impracticality in their actions. A clear show of that is that Bazarov's denial of art, moral norms and tradition coexists with paradoxial attachments, such as his love for Odintsova or his filial affection. Turguenev manages to expose the incompleteness of nihilism without any sort of heavy judgement. It is this ability to present an intelligent character, lucid, sometimes even sensitive, and yet unable to have a fulfiling live due to a disfunctional way of understanding reality that made me fall in love with the russian writer.</p>
<p>This pattern is repeated in protagonists from other novels made by Turguenev. In <em>The Diary of a Superflous Man</em>, Chulkaturin</p>
<p>(show these fates based on slowly dying are not a personal thing, but happens with other russian realist novelists, compare it to ffrench realism).</p>

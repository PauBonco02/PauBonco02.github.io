## About this Website

This website has been created with Pelican, a static site generator powered by Python. The theme used is **[Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex)** by Alexandre Vicenzi, with a few additional scripts I added to enable grid-based image visualization and a lightbox feature. You can check out the source code on my **[GitHub](https://github.com/PauBonco02/PauBonco02.github.io)**.

          I still remember when I first read <em>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</em>, by Oliver Sacks. It truly sparked my fascination with neuroscience.
          His writings go far beyond clinical observation; they are profound explorations of perception and human identity. In one story, a patient who lost 
          her sense of proprioception leads Sacks to meditate on the deep interdependence of mind and body. In another, an elderly woman with Tourette’s syndrome chooses 
          to live without medication, since the same dopaminergic activity that caused her tics also made her lively, expressive, and happy. Through such cases, Sacks 
          reflects on the delicate balance between neurological disorder and personal identity, becoming a pioneer in recognizing patient value — understanding that the goal 
          of medicine extends beyond symptom control to the preservation of individuality and the meaning of one’s life.

          This book made me decide to pursue Biomedical Engineering, since while I've always enjoyed maths and physics, I also wanted to help people in a direct and meaningful way,
          putting human well-being at the center of my work. I thought that a small tribute to such an inspiring author would be a fitting way to introduce my personal website.
